    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>To Make Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add palm sugar to a small pot and melt over medium 
                heat. Once the sugar is melting, keep stirring until it 
                darkens in colour (see video for colour). Immediately add
                water, fish sauce, and tamarind paste. The sugar will 
                harden immediately and this is okay.</li>
            <li>Bring sauce to a simmer, then turn off heat. The 
                hardened sugar will not have dissolved at this point, 
                but let it sit while you prep other ingredients and it 
                should be dissolved by the time you need it.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>To Make Pad Thai</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut drained noodles once with scissors so they are 
                half as long. This makes them easier to toss and 
                separate in the wok.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine tofu, garlic, shallots, preserved 
                radish, dried shrimp, and chili flakes.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
